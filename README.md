## DeepLearningProjects

I would like to say thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng and his colleagues for spreading knowledge to normal people and great courses sincerely.

## Note

This repo contains my work for this project. All the code base and images, are taken from Deep Learning Specialization Course on Coursera.
The reason I would like to create this repository is purely for academic use. I am really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with you about issues related with the course.
